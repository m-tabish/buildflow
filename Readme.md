# üöÄ Build Flow

### https://buildflow-omega.vercel.app/

## Project Overview

**Build Flow** is a web application that utilizes the [Gemini API](https://gemini.com) to return JSON responses. These responses are then populated in the frontend to create and visualize flowcharts using the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) library.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Package manager that comes with Node.js.

### Steps to Install
a
1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/build-flow.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

    Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
       
       cd build-flow

    ```
3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
 
   Navigate to the backend directory (if applicable) and install dependencies:
   ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
   ```
4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

    Navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable) and install dependencies:
    ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
    ```
## Running the Application
1. **Start Backend Server**

   From the backend directory, run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Application**

   From the client directory, run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Access the Application**
    
    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in your configuration) to access the application's frontend
    and http://localhost:3000 for the server.

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.


## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **Framework**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on [Railway.app](https://railway.app/).
- **API Interaction**: The backend interacts with the Gemini API to fetch data necessary for generating flowcharts.

### Frontend

- **Library**: [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), a library for building interactive flowcharts and node-based applications in React.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's state management to handle the flowchart data received from the backend.

## Features üåü

- **Dynamic Flowchart Generation**: Users can create flowcharts dynamically based on the data fetched from the Gemini API.
- **User Interaction**: The React Flow library allows for user interaction, enabling users to modify flowcharts easily.

## Issues Encountered ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Inconsistent API Responses**: The deployed server on Railway.app sometimes returns responses only 3 out of 5 times. Possible causes could include resource limitations, timeouts, or issues with handling multiple simultaneous requests.
- **Concurrency Handling**: There might be concerns about how the server handles multiple requests, especially if it is not designed to manage concurrent requests effectively.

## Future Considerations üîÆ

- **Collaboration**: Introduce a feature that allows users to collaborate on generating a roadmap, enabling multiple users to contribute and refine the flowchart together.

- **Customizability**: Add functionality for users to edit specific nodes or code generated by the AI, allowing for a more personalized and tailored roadmap that meets individual needs.

- **Manual Roadmap Creation**: Implement an option for users to create roadmaps manually without relying on AI. This will give users full control from the start, allowing them to add or remove steps and assign tasks to specific team members.
